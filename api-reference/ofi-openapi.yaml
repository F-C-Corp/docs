  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    The OpenFiskal API enables POS vendors and custom POS builders to integrate
    fiscalization compliance across multiple jurisdictions (Germany TSE, Austria RKSV,
    Italy RT, and more) through a single, unified API surface.

    ## Core Concept: Operations

    Everything that happens at a register is an **operation**. Each operation has a
    `start` and an `end` — and in many fiscal jurisdictions (notably Germany), both
    events are individually signed by the fiscal security device.

    This is not just a UX lifecycle. It is a legal requirement.

    ### Germany (TSE) Example

    In Germany, the TSE (Technische Sicherheitseinrichtung) mandates that the **start**
    and **end** of every POS transaction are independently signed. Both signatures must
    appear on the printed receipt.

    The flow looks like this:

    ```
    1. Cashier opens a sale for Table 3
       → POST /registers/reg_01/sales
       → TSE signs the start event
       → Platform returns: start_signature, transaction_counter=4821

    2. Items are added, customer orders dessert, splits the bill
       → PATCH /sales/op_01  (not a fiscal event — free mutations)

    3. Customer pays
       → POST /sales/op_01/complete
       → TSE signs the end event
       → Platform returns: end_signature, transaction_counter=4822, receipt

    Receipt contains:
      Start: counter=4821, sig=abc..., signed_at=19:02:11
      End:   counter=4822, sig=xyz..., signed_at=20:14:55
    ```

    Meanwhile, Table 7 and Table 1 have their own open operations with their own
    TSE-signed starts — all in-flight simultaneously on the same register.

    ### Why Start is a Fiscal Event

    Because the platform is involved from the very beginning, OpenFiskal becomes the
    **authoritative record of every open operation at every register, at all times**.
    If a register crashes mid-service, the platform holds the start signatures and
    open state. When it reconnects, fiscal integrity is preserved.

    ## Operation Lifecycle

    Every operation moves through the following states. The state transitions
    marked with 🔏 are **fiscal events** — they are signed by the fiscal security
    device and cannot be undone.

    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction TB
        [*] --> open : POST /registers/:id/sales\nPOST /registers/:id/refunds\n🔏 fiscal start signed
        open --> completed : POST .../complete\n🔏 fiscal end signed
        open --> abandoned : POST .../abandon\n(no fiscal document)
        completed --> voided : POST /registers/:id/voids\n🔏 fiscal reversal signed\n(before closing)

        note right of open : PATCH mutations are free here\n(items, discounts, customer)
    ```

    ### Fiscal Event Detail

    For jurisdictions that sign both the start and end of an operation
    (e.g. Germany TSE), the timeline looks like this:

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant POS
        participant OpenFiskal
        participant TSE

        POS->>OpenFiskal: POST /sales
        OpenFiskal->>TSE: Sign start event
        TSE-->>OpenFiskal: counter=4821, sig=abc...
        OpenFiskal-->>POS: fiscal.start_event (counter=4821)

        Note over POS,OpenFiskal: PATCH /sales — free mutations (no fiscal event)

        POS->>OpenFiskal: POST /sales/complete
        OpenFiskal->>TSE: Sign end event
        TSE-->>OpenFiskal: counter=4822, sig=xyz...
        OpenFiskal-->>POS: fiscal.end_event (counter=4822) + receipt
    ```

    ### Concurrent Operations

    Multiple operations can be open simultaneously on the same register.
    This is normal for hospitality (tables), mobility (fuel pumps, EV chargers),
    and workshop environments (service bays). Each open operation holds its own
    fiscally-signed start event independently.

    | Operation | State | Started | Counter | Note |
    |-----------|-------|---------|---------|------|
    | op_A | open | 19:02 | 4821 | table in progress |
    | op_B | open | 19:15 | 4823 | another table |
    | op_C | open | 18:45 | 4819 | waiting for card |
    | op_D | open | 20:01 | 4825 | just started |

    All four hold TSE-signed start events on register `reg_01`.
    Each completes independently when payment is confirmed.
    The daily closing can only happen once all are completed or abandoned.

    ## Operation Types

    Each operation type has its own endpoint with a strict, minimal schema.
    The unified `/operations` feed allows listing and reading across all types.

    | Type | Description |
    |---|---|
    | `sale` | Standard sale |
    | `refund` | Full or partial return |
    | `exchange` | Simultaneous refund + sale |
    | `void` | Cancellation of a completed operation before the daily closing. Produces a fiscal reversal document. |
    | `cash_movement` | Cash in / cash out |
    | `deposit` | Prepayment or reservation |
    | `deposit_capture` | Finalization of a prior deposit |
    | `training` | Non-fiscal staff training transaction |

    ## Authentication

    All API requests require a platform API key sent as a Bearer token.
    Platform integrators (POS vendors acting on behalf of merchants) pass an additional
    `OpenFiskal-Organization` header to scope requests to a specific merchant.

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer ofk_platform_...
    OpenFiskal-Organization: org_01HXYZ
    ```

    Register devices use a separate long-lived API key via the `X-Register-Api-Key` header.

    ## Idempotency

    All mutating endpoints accept an `Idempotency-Key` header. Strongly recommended
    for `start` and `complete` actions — retrying a fiscalization event without one
    risks duplicate fiscal records.

    ## Monetary Values

    All monetary amounts are integers in the **minor currency unit** (cents for EUR).
    No floats, ever.

      Individual POS terminals or logical fiscal devices.

      A register has two states: `active` (accepting operations) and `archived`
      (permanently retired). Fiscal compliance capabilities are managed separately
      via **Fiscal Units**.
  - name: Fiscal Units
    description: |
      A FiscalUnit represents the link between a register and a fiscal compliance
      capability (TSE in Germany, RKSV certificate in Austria, RT device in Italy).

      A register can have one active binding at a time. Past bindings are retained
      for audit history. Bindings can be replaced atomically — the old binding is
      decommissioned and a new one provisioned in a single call.

      ### Lifecycle

      ```
      provisioning ──► active ──► decommissioned
                         │
                       error ──► active (recover)
                         │
                       decommissioned
      ```

      - **provisioning**: Fiscal device is being initialized (TSE, RT, RKSV)
      - **active**: Ready to sign operations
      - **error**: Fiscal device failure (recoverable)
      - **decommissioned**: Permanently retired

      Standard sale operations. The most common operation type.

      **Lifecycle:** `open` → `completed` (or `abandoned`)

      Both the start and end are fiscal events. In Germany, both are TSE-signed.
  - name: Refunds

  - name: E-Invoicing
    description: |
      Electronic invoice creation, submission, and lifecycle management.

      E-invoicing is a **separate resource family from POS operations**. A POS
      operation (sale, refund) produces a fiscal receipt at the point of sale.
      An e-invoice is a structured document routed through a national authority
      to a recipient — B2B, B2G, or consumer-on-request.

      The two worlds connect via a **reference**, not a merge: a `SaleOperation`
      may carry a `references.invoice_id` when a customer at a POS requests a
      formal invoice. Each resource is independently complete.

      ### Jurisdictions

      | Code | Country/Region | System | Notes |
      |------|---------------|--------|-------|
      | `IT` | Italy | SDI / FatturaPA | Mandatory B2B since 2019 |
      | `ES-PV-VI` | Álava | TicketBAI | All businesses since 2022 |
      | `ES-PV-SS` | Gipuzkoa | TicketBAI | All businesses since 2022 |
      | `ES-PV-BI` | Bizkaia | TicketBAI + Batuz | Includes LROE ledger requirement |
      | `ES` | Spain (national) | Verifactu | Rolling out 2025 |

      ### Invoice Lifecycle

      ```mermaid
      stateDiagram-v2
          direction LR
          [*] --> draft
          draft --> submitted : POST /invoices/:id/submit
          submitted --> transmitted : authority acknowledged
          transmitted --> delivered : SDI delivered (Italy)
          delivered --> accepted : recipient accepted (Italy)
          delivered --> undeliverable : invalid recipient
          transmitted --> rejected_by_authority : format/validation error
          transmitted --> cancellation_requested : POST /invoices/:id/cancel
          delivered --> cancellation_requested : POST /invoices/:id/cancel
          accepted --> cancellation_requested : POST /invoices/:id/cancel
          cancellation_requested --> cancelled : authority confirmed

          note left of draft : Italy TD24: may remain\ndraft up to 12 days
          note right of transmitted : TicketBAI/Verifactu:\ntransmitted = terminal success
      ```

      `delivered` and `accepted` are SDI-specific states. Italy routes invoices
      through SDI to the recipient, who has a 15-day acceptance window.
      TicketBAI and Verifactu have no recipient delivery step — transmitted = done.

      ### Document Types

      | `document_type` | Description | IT (FatturaPA) | ES (Verifactu/TBAI) |
      |----------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
      | `invoice` | Standard B2B invoice | TD01 | F1 |
      | `simplified_invoice` | B2C or low-value B2B | TD07 | F2 |
      | `credit_note` | Full or partial cancellation | TD04 | R1 |
      | `debit_note` | Additional charge on prior invoice | TD05 | — |
      | `deferred_invoice` | Italy: issued after delivery (up to 12 days) | TD24 | — |
      | `self_invoice` | Reverse charge scenarios | TD17 / TD18 / TD19 | — |

  - name: Fiscal Certificates
    description: |
      Signing certificates required for e-invoicing jurisdictions.

      TicketBAI, Verifactu, and SDI (via intermediary) all require a qualified
      certificate to sign fiscal documents. OpenFiskal acts as the signing
      intermediary — vendors provision certificates per organization and
      jurisdiction, and OpenFiskal handles signing, chain maintenance, and
      renewal reminders.

  - name: Fiscal Portal Credentials
    description: |
      Government portal credentials that OpenFiskal holds on behalf of the
      merchant and uses to authenticate to country-specific fiscal authority
      portals.

      Unlike signing certificates (which are cryptographic keys), portal
      credentials are username/password pairs for government web portals.
      OpenFiskal stores them encrypted and uses them only to submit fiscal
      data on the merchant's behalf.

      ### Jurisdiction coverage

      | Portal | Jurisdiction | Used for |
      |--------|-------------|----------|
      | `fisconline` | Italy (IT) | B2C commercial document transmission to AdE |
      | `entratel` | Italy (IT) | Corporate/accountant variant of Fisconline |
      | `finanz_online` | Austria (AT) | RKSV registration and transmission to BMF |

      Germany does not require portal credentials — the TSE device signs
      transactions locally and no government portal login is needed.

      ### Credential lifecycle

      Portal credentials expire periodically (Fisconline: every 60 days;
      FinanzOnline: annually). OpenFiskal tracks expiry and sends renewal
      reminders at 14 and 3 days before expiry. After expiry, fiscal
      transmission is blocked until credentials are rotated.

      Credential values are **write-only** — raw secrets are never returned
      after provisioning. Rotating credentials requires a `PATCH` with the
      new values.

      Certificates are scoped to an organization and a jurisdiction. An
      organization may hold certificates for multiple jurisdictions simultaneously.

        If the token has already been consumed or has expired, the endpoint

      operationId: createRegister
      summary: Create a register
      description: |
        Creates a register in `active` state with no fiscal unit. The register
        is a POS device — it becomes fiscally operational once a fiscal unit
        is provisioned via `POST /registers/:id/fiscal-units`.

        The platform maintains the authoritative list of all open operations per register.
        If a register crashes and reconnects, it reconciles against this state.

  /registers/{registerId}/activate:

      summary: Activate a register
      deprecated: true
      description: |
        **Deprecated.** Use `POST /registers/:id/fiscal-units` instead.

        This endpoint is retained for backward compatibility. Under the hood it
        creates a fiscal unit for the register. New integrations should use
        the fiscal units API directly.

        Triggers jurisdiction-specific fiscal registration:
        - **Germany**: Initializes the TSE, establishes the signature chain
        - **Italy**: Activates the RT device with Agenzia delle Entrate
        - **Austria**: Establishes the RKSV signature chain, registers AES key

        Idempotent — calling on an already-active register returns the existing
        fiscal registration data.

        ### Register Credentials (Optional)

        Pass `issue_register_credential: true` to receive a register-scoped API
        key in the response. Use this for device-direct integrations (EV chargers,
        unattended kiosks). The key is returned **once only** — store it immediately
        and push to the device over a secure provisioning channel.

        Server-side platform integrations (Shopify-style) should omit this — the
        platform token already covers all register operations.

        See the Security Model section in the API overview for full guidance.

        The register must not already have an active fiscal unit. To replace
        an existing binding, use `POST /registers/:id/fiscal-units/replace`.

        The binding starts in `provisioning` state and transitions to `active`
        once the fiscal device is initialized.

      summary: Start a sale
      description: |
        Opens a new sale operation. This is a **fiscal event** — the platform
        records the start and, in jurisdictions that require it, signs it immediately.

        The response includes `fiscal.start_event` with the start-side signature and
        transaction counter. Store this — it must appear on the final receipt.

        Multiple sales can be open simultaneously on the same register (restaurant
        tables, fuel pumps, workshop bays). Each gets its own fiscally-signed start.

        Finalizes the sale. This is a **fiscal event** — the platform signs the end,

        The receipt is now available at `GET /operations/:id/receipt`.

        ### Germany TSE Example

        After completion, `fiscal` contains both the start and end signatures,
        as required by KassenSichV. Both must be printed on the receipt.

        ```json
        "fiscal": {
          "regime": "tse",

          }
        }

        The `qr_data` value follows the DSFinV-K QR format and is printed verbatim
        on the receipt.

      summary: Start an exchange
      description: |
        Opens a new exchange operation. An exchange is an atomic return + new sale
        that references the original operation. Returned items and new items are
        tracked separately in `returned_line_items` and `new_line_items`. Payments
        settle the net difference. A single fiscal document covers the exchange.

      description: |
        Pure liveness ping. The register calls this on a regular schedule
        (every 30–60 seconds). OpenFiskal derives the register's operational
        status from heartbeat recency and the reported `status` field.

        The response carries `server_time` so the register can detect local
        clock drift — accurate timestamps are a fiscal requirement in many
        jurisdictions.

        Register devices authenticate using `X-Register-Api-Key` rather than
        a full OAuth token, suitable for resource-constrained hardware.

        Called by the register the moment the cash drawer opens. Must be
        logged immediately — not batched or deferred — because the timestamp
        is fiscally significant.

        An opening can be linked to a POS operation (e.g. the drawer opened
        at the end of a sale) or be standalone (e.g. a manager opened the
        drawer to check the float). Both are valid and both must be logged.

      summary: Create an invoice
      description: |
        Creates and submits an electronic invoice through the appropriate
        national authority for the organization's jurisdiction.

        The submission is synchronous where the authority allows it (TicketBAI,
        Verifactu). For SDI (Italy), the invoice is submitted and `state` moves
        to `transmitted` once SDI acknowledges receipt — delivery to the
        recipient is tracked separately via `delivery_status`.

        ### Draft mode

        Pass `submit: false` to create the invoice in `draft` status without
        submitting. Useful for Italy's deferred invoicing window (TD24 invoices
        may be issued up to 12 days after delivery of goods/services). Call
        `POST /invoices/:id/submit` when ready.

        ### Linking to a POS operation

        To link this invoice to a POS sale (e.g. customer requests a fattura
        at a physical POS), pass `references.operation_id`. The sale record
        will be updated to carry `references.invoice_id` in return.

        The original invoice status moves to `cancellation_requested` until
        the authority acknowledges, then to `cancelled`.

        For **partial** corrections, use `POST /invoices` with
        `document_type: credit_note` and `references.original_invoice_id`.

        - **TicketBAI**: TicketBAI XML signed with XAdES-EPES

      operationId: createFiscalCertificate
      summary: Provision a fiscal signing certificate
      description: |
        Provisions a qualified signing certificate for an organization and
        jurisdiction. OpenFiskal uses this certificate to sign all fiscal
        documents on the organization's behalf.

        The certificate must be obtained from the relevant authority before
        provisioning:
        - **Italy (SDI)**: Qualified certificate from an accredited CA, or
          delegate signing to OpenFiskal directly via an intermediary agreement
        - **TicketBAI**: Certificate issued by the relevant Hacienda Foral
          (one per province — Álava, Gipuzkoa, Bizkaia each require separate
          certificates)
        - **Verifactu**: Qualified certificate from an accredited Spanish CA

        Upload the certificate as a base64-encoded PKCS#12 bundle with its
        private key. OpenFiskal stores it encrypted and uses it only for
        document signing.

        ### Certificate Lifecycle

        OpenFiskal monitors certificate expiry and sends renewal reminders
        at 60, 30, and 7 days before expiry. After expiry, document submission
        is blocked until a replacement is provisioned.

      tags: [Fiscal Portal Credentials]
      operationId: createFiscalPortalCredential
      summary: Provision portal credentials
      description: |
        Provisions government portal credentials for an organization and
        jurisdiction. OpenFiskal stores the credentials encrypted at rest and
        uses them only to submit fiscal data on the merchant's behalf.

        The `portal_type` discriminates the credential shape:

        - **`fisconline`** — Italian Fisconline (Codice Fiscale holder, B2C RT):
          `pin` + `password` + `tax_id_number`. Password expires every 60 days.
        - **`entratel`** — Italian Entratel (accountants, corporate filers):
          `pin` + `password` + `tax_id_number`. Same rotation cadence as Fisconline.
        - **`finanz_online`** — Austrian BMF portal (RKSV):
          `participant_id` + `user_id` + `pin`. Expires annually.

        After provisioning, call `/validate` to confirm the credentials work
        against the live portal before commissioning any registers.

        Credentials are write-only — raw values are never returned after this
        call. Only masked representations (e.g. `pin: "****3"`) are returned
        on subsequent reads.

      description: |
        Performs a live authentication attempt against the government portal
        using the stored credentials. Updates `state` and `last_validated_at`
        based on the result.

        This call is synchronous but may take a few seconds depending on
        portal response times. The result reflects the portal's actual
        response — not just format validation.

        Use this:
        - After provisioning new credentials, before commissioning registers
        - After rotating credentials (PATCH), to confirm the new values work
        - Manually when `state` transitions to `invalid` and credentials have
          been renewed by the merchant

        A successful validation sets `state` to `valid`. A failed attempt
        sets it to `invalid` and includes the portal's error message in
        `validation_error`.

        ### Terminal states

        | State | Fiscal document |
        |-------|----------------|
        | `completed` | ✅ Yes |
        | `abandoned` | ❌ No |
        | `voided` | ✅ (reversal) |

        If a fiscalization fault occurs (e.g. the fiscal device is
        unreachable), the API returns an error — the operation stays
        in its current state and the POS can retry.

        - `transmitted`: Authority confirmed receipt. For TicketBAI/Verifactu,
          this is the terminal success state. For SDI, delivery to recipient
          still pending.
        - `delivered`: SDI only. Invoice delivered to the recipient's inbox.
          Recipient has 15 days to accept or reject.
        - `accepted`: SDI only. Recipient explicitly accepted the invoice.
          Implicit acceptance occurs after 15 days with no rejection.
        - `undeliverable`: SDI only. SDI could not deliver to the recipient
          (invalid `codice_destinatario` or PEC address). Invoice is fiscally
          valid but the vendor must contact the recipient directly.
        - `rejected_by_authority`: Authority rejected the document due to
          format or validation errors. Check `fiscal_errors`. Must correct
          and resubmit as a new invoice.
        - `cancellation_requested`: Full cancellation initiated, awaiting
          authority acknowledgment.
        - `cancelled`: Invoice fully cancelled. A corrective document has been
          issued and accepted.
